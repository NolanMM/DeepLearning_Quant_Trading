## I. Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for quantitative trading. This model aims to leverage historical and real-time financial data to predict stock prices accurately, thereby enabling the execution of profitable trading strategies. The project will focus on integrating multiple data sources, cleaning and processing the data, training the LSTM model, and deploying it in a real-time trading environment.

## II. Usage
### A. Set Up

<details><summary><strong> 1. Create Virtual Environment (Python 3.8) </strong></summary>

* If you want to create a new virtual enviroment, you can use the following command in the terminal of the project directory:

  * In Windows or Linux, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    python -m venv venv
  ```

  * Then, you can activate the virtual enviroment by using the following command:
  
  ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  * In MacOs, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
  ```

  * Then, you can activate the virtual enviroment by using the following command:
  
  ```bash
    source venv/Scripts/activate
  ```

* Make sure the virtual environment needed for project is activate with corresponding project directory, you can use the following command:

  * In Windows or Linux, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  * In MacOs, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    source venv/Scripts/activate
  ```
